Coverage by Duration (Definition 4.1)

Uses the implied duration of the activities present in the model but missing from the
log to estimate coverage.

    dur(sigma)           : duration of a trace sigma from its timestamps
    mi(m, sigma)          : trace indexes (excl. index 1) whose activity label is part
                            of the alphabet act(m) of a (sub)model m
    sdur(m, sigma)        : summed / averaged duration attributable to m
    cov_dt(m, m_sub, L)   : coverage by duration of submodel m_sub w.r.t. model m,
                            computed over log L

A trace sigma is expected to be an ordered sequence of events, each of which provides
    - event['concept:name']    the activity label, and
    - event['time:timestamp']  a datetime timestamp.
This matches the pm4py / XES event representation already used elsewhere in this
project (see e.g. probabilities.py, disco.py, pvoid.py), so a pm4py event log (or
any list of such traces) can be passed directly as `log`.

skip_probs is the same dict already used by coverage_mass: ProcessTree node ->
P_skip(node). Here it supplies P_skip(m, m_sub, L) for the submodel pt.

    total_dur (optional): the denominator sum_{sigma in L} dur(sigma), precomputed.
    Pass this in when calling coverage_by_duration for many nodes over the same
